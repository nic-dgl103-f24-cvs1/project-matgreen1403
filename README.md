Summary:

Kitty Coleman Woodland Gardens. url: https://woodlandgardens.ca/

The purpose of the website is to inform and funnel customers to the business.
Providing potential customers with essential information on what to expect when visiting.From pricing, location, dates, and ways to contact. 
The webiste also showcases many appealiong photos of the venue to attract customers.  

The main target audience for the website is most likely local customers or customers travelling into town. Because the site works as a funnel. 
The product requires the customer to be in person. I believe the main target demographic are families. The events hosted at the venue tends to cater towards a family and community feel.
However, I'm sure there are a wide variety of potential customers.  

You are trying to answer any questions a potential customer may have. When are events happening? Where is it? What does it look like? How much does it cost for me (and others)? 
If the customer has a question that cannot be answered by the website; you would like the customer to use the contact form action. 
Essentially it is a thorough advertisment for the venue.

The webiste design and layout of the content feels unorganised. 
There are minor accessibility issues like low contrast. Overall it did well in performance, accessiblity and best practices. 
I believe the best improvements would be in the layout and delivery of the content, especially since that aids in the main goal of the website.  

Look & feel:

Mood: Calm, approachable, inviting, naturalistic. The website needs to fit the theme of the gardens with a inviting and approachable feel. This is crucial to convey information to the customer.
