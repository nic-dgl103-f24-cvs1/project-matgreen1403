      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          Kitty Coleman Woodland Gardens are an act of love, developed by one
          man in an effort to fulfill a dream to share with all. Bryan
          Zimmerman's Xmas Tree Farm and Santa's Barn are well-known in the
          Comox Valley during the winter months. He always knew he lived in a
          beautiful spot but it wasn't until he began clearing out some of the
          thick brush on his 24 acres of forested land that he thought of a way
          to share it with others. Studying the interesting topography and
          unique layout gave him the idea for creating the woodland gardens.
          Over the next two years he began to build his wonderland dream
          clearing the underbrush by hand to reveal a forest floor more
          beautiful than he had imagined. Day by day, using his back and
          wheelbarrow, he laid over a mile of bark mulch paths meandering
          through the woods. Unwilling to disturb plant and tree root systems
          more than absolutely necessary or to use heavy equipment which would
          destroy the landscape, he dragged all brush and debris out manually.
          The beauty of the gardens is that most of the forests natural finery
          has been left alone, embellished, but not overwhelmed by cultivation.
          The gardens are especially designed to showcase the most beautiful of
          all shrubs: the rhododendron. Bryan has planted over 3000
          rhododendrons of different varieties and sizes as well as companion
          plants and cultivated trees, all blending into the breathtakingly
          beautiful natural surroundings. To take a walk through this woodland
          garden gives one a feeling of peace and well-being. In the upper area
          he's used the land contours to his advantage in the placing of several
          ponds. The serenity draws one to follow the soft cedar bark paths, and
          the enticing trails that disappear into the woodlands. Granite rocks
          from the valley mountains line the pathways. The filtered sunlight,
          sparkling through the trees in an endless array of patterns lift your
          spirits. You inhale the sensual earthiness. The placement of a rustic
          hand-built bench here and there adds charm as well as providing the
          visitor with an opportunity to sit, meditate and listen to the birds.
          In the background, Kitty Coleman Creek babbles fluidly on its winding
          way down to the Georgia Strait. A Polynesian-style gazebo built from
          tree poles provides a sheltered place to sit and ponder, watch the
          great blue heron fly overhead, observe the birds at the feeders which
          are suspended around the gazebo, or even listen to the sea lions
          barking from the mouth of the creek a few hundred yards away.
          Licorice, deer, lady and sword ferns all proliferate, blending the
          wild with the cultivated. Looking closely, visitors will observe
          smaller natural flora such as sweet boxwood, broad-leaf starflower,
          fawn lily, Oregon grape, vanilla leaf and bleeding hearts on the
          forest floor. In the lower, or hidden garden, woodland paths descend
          to travel along Kitty Coleman Creek, where a pair of wood ducks
          happily meander. The view of the creek through filtered light and
          overhanging trees is one that inspired a group of artists to ask
          permission to paint there. Here, larger rhododendrons have been placed
          informally along the natural slope, giving the wanderer a surprising
          burst of colour. The idea is that anyone visiting will never see the
          same scenes twice. The rhododendrons bloom mainly from March to the
          end of June. Their dark green foliage is so attractive year round that
          they are one of British Columbia's favorite shrubs.
